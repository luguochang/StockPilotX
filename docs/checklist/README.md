# Checklist Docs

This directory tracks executable checklists and progress logs for large implementation batches.

## Structure
- `docs/checklist/YYYY-MM-DD/README.md`: index for the day.
- `docs/checklist/YYYY-MM-DD/*-checklist.md`: actionable checklist with completion marks.
- `docs/checklist/YYYY-MM-DD/*-execution-log.md`: chronological execution notes, test evidence, and commit references.

## Rules
- Update checklist status immediately after each completed implementation step.
- Record self-test command/results for each step.
- Keep commit ids in execution log for traceability.
